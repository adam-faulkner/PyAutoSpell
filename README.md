# PyAutoSpell


I wrote this library as quick pre-processing component for text files. Given a potentially misspelled text, PyAutoSpell identifies any misspellings in the text, generates a set of candidate corrections for the misspelling, and then uses an ngram model to determine the probability that a given candidate correction is the best correction for that misspelling. It then incorporates the highest probability correction into the final, corrected text.
